## Original distributions
NBA fantasy. The source of pure joy and stress for the most of us. If you're reading this, that means that you're deep enough into it, and you probably know that there are two types of NBA Fantasy leagues - points and categories. Categories mostly require more strategy and planning, and therefore they are more popular choice. 
For the last 30ish years, Z-score has been the golden standard for NBA fantasy category rankings. Every year, we draft, rank and evaluate player based on their ranking. But have you ever question yourself how is that rank calculated? Probably, as well as myself, you haven't. 

I was listening to [Josh Lloyd](https://twitter.com/redrock_bball) podcast where he was talking about how the z-score is being calculated. It effectively assumes that the distribution of the data is Gaussian/Normal. I was thinking to myself, well almost everything is normally distributed when the sample size is big enough, and here in the NBA, we are talking about thousand and thousand of shots, steals, blocks, etc.
